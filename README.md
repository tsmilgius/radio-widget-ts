This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

Widget is mostly static - selecting station is the only action available. After selecting
station, it should toggle it and display its name at the bottom of the widget.

Rest of the buttons should be clickable but it should trigger no action.
