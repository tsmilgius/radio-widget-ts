## _Static Radio Widget_

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template. 
Deployed version can be found here:
https://tsmilgius.github.io/radio-widget-ts/
[Redux-logger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-logger) middleware allows to see actions and state change in live app after 'Inspect' option is selected in browser. 

>Widget is mostly static - selecting station is the only action available.
>After selecting station, it should toggle it and display its name at the bottom of the widget.
>Rest of the buttons should be clickable but it should trigger no action.

> TODO:
`Add more tests tests`
